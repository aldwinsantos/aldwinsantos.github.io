## Maintanable, Scalable, and Efficient
When encountering common problems that come up in software designs, Design Patterns are used to solve said problems. Design patterns improve the quality of code and speeds up the process of 
development. Developers use these patterns to write their code in a more maintainable, scalable, and efficient way. Design patterns can also be applied and used in many different projects and 
are based off of the developer's experience in coding. This is because they make codes readable and understable for others.

## Solving Problems with Design Patterns
There are three types of design patterns, Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Behavioral Patterns. These patterns are commonly used by developers everytime they code. 
Creational Patterns focuses on mechanisms to ensure flexibility and reuse. Structual Patterns deal with object composition to form larger structures. Lastly, Behavioral Patterns focuses on 
communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities. These three types of patterns are well-established solutions and they promote modularity and flexibility in coding.

Creational Patterns focuses on simplifying object creation and initialization processes, making sure that the system remains flexible and scalable. Common Creational Patterns include 
Singleton, Factory method, and Builder. These patterns are used to support variations or configurations in object creation and to make codes more readable and maintainable by hiding 
complext creation logic.

Structural Patterns focuses on organizing and composing classes and objects to form larger structures to make sure of flexibility and efficiency. Common Structural Patterns include Adapter,
Composite, and Decorator. These patterns are used in creating relationships between classes and objects that are flexible and enhances code maintainability by creating modular, 
well-established interfaces.

Behavioral Patterns on the other hand, focuses on communacation and interactions between objects, telling them how to work together to perform their tasks. Common Behavioral Patterns include 
Observer, Strategy, and Command. These patterns are used when the interactions between objects becomes complex and troublesome. To also make sure that responsibilities are distributed efficiently, 
Behavioral patterns are used. 

As you have read, Design Patterns are used by developers everytime they code. These patterns can also be easily applied when encountering problems in real life. Being able to be responsible  
and efficient in everything that we do and to be able to communicate well with others, we can easily conquer and solve problems by applying these patterns.
