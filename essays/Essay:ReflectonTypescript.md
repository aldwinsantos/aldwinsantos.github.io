## Typescript and Other Programming Languages
Through out all of my programming career so far, the only languages I have used are Java and a little bit of C and Javascript. After doing the first practice WOD and learning a little bit about Typescript, I found out that it is very similar to Java and Javascript. I have not done/finished my ES6 or Professional Portfolio yet. The WOD/Practice WODs are the only experience I have with Typescript so far, so I don't have a lot of things to say about the language. However, that would probably change the next following weeks of the semester, as I get more hands-on experience in programming using Typescript.

## Are Practice WODs Useful?
I find the practice WODs very useful. Especially to someone like me who has no prior experience in using Typescript. The practice WODs are a great learning tool not only to prepare for the actual WODs but also in learning how to use Typescript. 

Learning how to code is like learning MATH to me. I need constant practice and exposure in order to learn and be proficient at it. If I do not get constant practice and exposure at something, I tend to forget them. That is probably why I am bad at coding. I don't practice as much. That is something I am trying to change because I know it will help me alot in the future.
