*Reflection: The Importance of Coding Standards.*

Being able to code should not be the only thing a programmer is proficient at. Yes, the code works, but what happens when someone or a person from a team has to read and understand the code but it is messy and all over the place? Instead of making the work easier completing and creating a working program, they are now faced with a program that is difficult to read and understand, making their job more difficult than easy. This is where coding standards come in. Your code being readable and easy to understand will make not only your team's work easier, but yours as well. Something as simple as indents, brackets, spaces and comments make codes easier to read and understand. Not to mention, a good structured code is nice to look at and would make people more engaged in reading it. Coding standards do actually help you learn programming languages easier. Being able to read code so neat is just woderful. Do you know what the next best thing is after a code that works? How it looks. Perfect spaces, indents, no red squiggly lines. Now that is a sight for sore eyes. The quality of the code is just as important as the code working. This applies specially in work environments where people need to work as a team to accomplish a tasks.

## Using ESLint with VSCode

Using ESLint with VSCode has been a welcome challenge. The use of ESLint has been both a painful and rewarding experience. Trying to get rid of those irritating red squiggly lines has been quiet difficult at times, but is expected to get easier the more it is used and the more experience and practice one gets.

The image above displays an example of bad typecript code using VSCode. After ESLint was installed, VSCode reports thirty-two errors. Now compare it to the image below after the errors were fixed.

With ESLint, we were able to find the errors and easily fix them. Also, see how much better and cleaner the code looks compared to the previous one with the errors and red squiggly lines. ESLint helps to not only identify errors but also how to fix them. This way our code can be more consistent and we can avoid bugs, styling errors, etc. This has been our first week working with ESLint and I will be looking forward to the following weeks that we will be using it.
