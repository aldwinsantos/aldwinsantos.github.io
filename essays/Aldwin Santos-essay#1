The Javascript Experience

Through all my programming career so far, the only languages I have used are Java and a little bit of C. After doing the first practice WOD and learning a little bit about Javascript, I found out that it is very similar to Java.  I have not done/finished my ES6 or Professional portfolio yet, and the WOD is the only practice I have with Javascript so I don’t have a lot of things to say about the language yet. However, that would probably change the next following weeks of the semester, as I get more hands-on experience in programming using Javascript.

I find the practice WODs very useful. Especially to someone like me who has no prior experience in using Javascript. The practice WODs are a great learning tool not only to prepare for the actual WODs but also in learning how to use Javascript.

 Learning how to code is like learning MATH to me. I need constant practice and exposure in order to learn and be proficient at it. If I do not get constant practice and exposure at something I tend to forget about it. That is probably why I am bad at coding. It is because I don’t practice as much. That is something I am trying to change because I know it will help me alot in the future.
