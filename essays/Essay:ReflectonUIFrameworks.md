## UI Frameworks And Their Advantages
Bootstrap 5 is a popular CSS framework. The framework provides advantages such as being able to modify and change colors, layouts, and style of a website/project. Bootstrap provides easy to use features that can make a project easier and faster to optimize and design. Learning Bootstrap 5 and how to use UI Frameworks in general really did make it seem like learning a new programming language. It can be just as complicated and at times even more frustrating than programming and both can be very time consuming.

## What about raw HTML/CSS?
Now, why not just use raw HTML and CSS? The answer is yes, you can. Raw HTML/CSS do give the user complete control over the design and use of a website. However, UI Frameworks makes it simpler and faster, with their easy to use features, to create a project or website. Simply put, both UI Frameworks and raw HTML/CSS have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is up to the user which they prefer or which they are more comfortable in using.
